# Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon

This project implements a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path (in terms of movie collaborations) between two actors in a movie database. 
The algorithm finds the least number of connections(movies) that connect two actors, similar to the popular "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" concept.

Run the program with: 
  python3 degrees.py <small/large>, then input the two names.
